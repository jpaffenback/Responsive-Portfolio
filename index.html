                <p>My name is Jason Paffenback, an Atlanta Georgia native with a very unique last name. 
                 I graduated from Georgia State University with degree in Economics and minor in Sociology.
                 I landed my first real job in banking right after graduating. Here's a fun fact, the company 
                 is located only a couple miles down the road from the hospital where I was born. 
            </p>

            <p>After 8+ years in my current position I have realized I am ready for a change and
                new challenge. I am back in school (Georgia Institute of Technology more commonly referred
                to as Georgia Tech) learning new skill sets to compliment my past experience in opening new doors
                for me. I want to be challenged to learn new things and create really cool stuff along the way.
                I want to be free of the 9-5 rat-race commonly found in more traditional feilds such as banking.
